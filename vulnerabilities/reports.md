Applications:
  * [05-2011] XMind: In may 2011 I found a DLL hijacking vulnerability in Xmind 3.2.1 on Windows. The vulnerable DLL was *\plugin\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.win32.win3 2.x86_1.0.200.v20090519\eclipse_1206.dll* (folder name could change between different versions). So I notifiate the vulnerability to the editor in may 2011. This is corrected in the new Xmind version 3.3.0 (call Xmind 2012), this new version was released in august 2012.
